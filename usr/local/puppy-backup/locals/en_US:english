LOC215="This app is a GUI for the mirdir package (19k). This backup program is a simple way to make one directory like another i.e. mirroring. First run it will copy the entire source-directory to the mirror-directory. The mirror function will then just update the mirror-directory. It will delete files on the mirror-directory if they don't exist on source-directory. Be careful, think twice and check settings again. The mirror directory must not be a partition! Choose a directory that is empty initially. The source directory can also be an entire partition or USB stick, but be careful that you have enough empty space to do mirroring. Pschedule can be used as well with Puppy backup using the commands found in /root/.config/PUPPY_BACKUP/COMMAND_LIST or click 'Log' button. Note that each source folder must have its own separate mirror folder. The mirror-directory should not be on the same harddisk that stores your main data. Do NOT think your data is safe when saving mirror-files on another partition. It is still the same disk, and when it crashes, it all does. Here's a tip: Buy an external USB harddrive. See also mirdir documentation. Config file location: $HOME/.config/PUPPY_BACKUP/tmp1/config. Created after first mirror."
