Ubuntulooks is an engine forked from Clearlooks 2.7 to bring a unique look to Ubuntu.

It was developed during a UI Sprint where we (the Clearlooks developers Daniel Borgmann and Richard Stellingwerff) where brought together. This UI Sprint focussed on the 'look and feel' for the Dapper Drake release and was sponsored by Canonical.

A big thanks to Mark Shuttleworth for making it possible. :-)
